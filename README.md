# Ansible Examples used for DevNation Tech Talks

Here you will find various examples used in the 
[DevNation Tech Talks](https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/) that
I have been involved in.

## Subdirectories

Each subdirectory in this repo is meant to be a stand-alone example, it will be
date coded YYYYMMDD to reference the point in time it was done. Each
subdirectory is meant to be self contained, will house its own README.md on
what the example is, how to set it up, how to run the examples, etc.
